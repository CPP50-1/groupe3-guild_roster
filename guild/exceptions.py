"""Custom exception hierarchy and a context manager that batches validation
errors instead of raising on the first one.

PROVIDED, WORKING — not a TODO. Character (Day 1 onward) and Field (Day 4)
both raise these, so this needs to work from day one. It's also worth
reading closely before Day 3: `batch_validation` below is a complete,
working example of the exact `@contextlib.contextmanager` pattern you'll
be asked to write yourself for `guild_transaction` in dungeon.py — use it
as your reference, not just documentation.
